## A-Channel-level-Pruning-Strategy-for-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This repo shows some code about the pruning strategy in the paper "A Channel-level Pruning Strategy for Convolutional Neural Networks".  
- The file "prune.ipynb" contains some code about the pruning process. In this file we use SE-BN-Inception for the example. You can download the network structure file and model parameters file in https://github.com/hujie-frank/SENet. We use Caffe to do this work. This is not a complete code but should be enough to show the pruning process.
## Highlights
network pruning based on attention.
